Here you build request to "Services Management" service. This service allow you to create service,
        assign it to user and construct data input form to let other people construct requests to new service.
        Also pre-services list allows request to travel throughout multiple services to build business process.
        Pre-services are not implemented yet (you can enter but Request will go to first pre-service and reply will be generated).
        Service this is something like mailing list but now we send Request only to the first user, supporting this Service.
        For the future implementation - different methods of load balancing.
