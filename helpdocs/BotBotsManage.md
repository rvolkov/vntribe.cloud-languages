Here you build request to "Bots Management" service. This service allow you to assign activated for your 
            VNT bots to different groups, every bot will need to have own
            username and support own service. Bots are scripts now but with goal to also support external API services.
            Bots are implemented as Python program plus Vue.js fronend. We can dynamically add new bots to the system.
