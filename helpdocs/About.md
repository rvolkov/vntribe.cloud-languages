# About vnt.space

For experiments to understand VNT Spaces work we recomment you create your own VNT by menu [Options/Create new VNT] and do your learning there. You can add several users in different groups on your one login and switch between them with "User@VNT" selector in the left upper corner.

Чтобы попробовать VNTSpaces мы рекомендуем создать свое собственное VNT через меню [Настройки/Создать новый VNT] и тренироваться в этом новом VNT. Вы можете добавить несколько ползователей в разные группы и привязать их всех к одному эккаунту чтобы потом переключаться между ними с селектора "nickname@VNT" в левом верхнем углу.

Web-portal with API service to help groups of people to manage itself by maintaining connections and deliver messages with attempt to do it without information losses on human-2-human communications. For it all the peoples' interactions are downgraded to transactions with a formal logic. Because of simplified interactions, software applications can be integrated as equal users in the teams. Our goal is to help the group or company operate as a single body in interest of members.

Это веб-портал и API сервис для того чтобы организовать свмоуправление группами людей через управление их взаимодействием и обменом сообщениями с целью сделать это без потерь информации. Для этого все взаимодействия между людьми искуственно упрощаются до уровня транзакционных сообщений с формальной логикой. Из-за упрощения во взаимодействиях мы можем интегрировать приложения и устройства в цепочки людей внтури групп как обычные пользователи. В результате люди, приложения и устройства позволяют организации работать как единое целое в интересах участников.

## Quick start

          <li>create <strong>VNT</strong> for your group or organization</li>
          <li>create groups</li>
          <li>start to invite other people to your VNT in different groups or for learning purposes you can add multiple VNTs
            users in your VNT on your single account (and switch between users with VNT switch on the left upper corner)
          </li>
          <li>create first services and assign them to people</li>
          <li>manage members' requests to create new Services, Groups and add new members</li>
        </ul>
        People in your group (organization):
        <ul>
          <li>need to be registered in <strong>VNT Spaces</strong> web portal</li>
          <li>use it to for their daily interactions and services delivery</li>
        </ul>
        As a result, system will:
        <ul>
          <li>build and show dynamical map of your organization's connections, workflows and operations</li>
          <li>recommend points, most effective for automation</li>
          <li>allow you to move operations from people to automated tools (bots in VNT Spaces terminology)</li>
        </ul>

## Is it free?

        <ul>
          All the features and basic <strong>Bots</strong> are free. As we have expences to support
          infrastructure, we plan to insert subscription-based services, but only for customers with
          high consumption of resources (storage and/or number of users). Some additional <strong>Bots</strong>
          can use external resources and have subscription or events-based cost. We don't keep your billing information,
          you will need to enter your registered data every time to have money transaction to pay or receive sum,
          but we keep checksums, different from registration information will not be accepted.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>VNT</strong>?

        <ul>
          <strong>VNT - Virtual Nomadic Tribe</strong> - name, registered in <strong>VNT Spaces</strong>,
          for group/company/anything under one administration, built from people, applications, robots, anything
        </ul>

## What are <strong>Nodes</strong>?

        <ul>
          <strong>Node</strong> is a user (login) in the <strong>VNT Spaces</strong>, assigned to any
          <strong>VNT</strong>. <strong>Node</strong> can be real human or it can be application.
          People, robots and applications, all are <strong>Nodes</strong> with the same rights, use same API,
          they build flexible groups and deliver services to each other.
          <strong>Node</strong> is main building block of <strong>VNT</strong> and we think about
          <strong>Node</strong> as about <strong>Enterpreneur</strong>,
          even if <strong>Node</strong> can be not really human.
          For the people <strong>VNT Spaces</strong> portal has web-based client, converting 
          usual human2web interaction
          to API calls with <strong>VNT Spaces</strong> service. Applications and robots use direct API access.
          No any difference
          between them in <strong>VNT</strong>. API is opened and anybody can develop for it application, 
          robot or client for humans.
          Nodes form routable network to deliver services requests, services responses and needed approvals.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Group</strong>?

        <ul>
          <strong>Nodes</strong> without control on their communications between each others (for example, team, 
          working together on one project, or team members, doing the same work). 
          Communications between <strong>Groups</strong> require approve from <strong>Curator</strong>.
        </ul>

## Who is <strong>Enterpreneur</strong>?

          This is a <strong>Node</strong>, inside <strong>Group</strong>, inside <strong>VNT</strong>,
          providing <strong>Service</strong> (and actively working to 
          support as many as possible <strong>Services</strong>) for other <strong>Nodes</strong>.
        </ul>

## Who is <strong>Connector</strong>?

        <ul>
          This is <strong>Node</strong>, member of 2 or more <strong>Groups</strong>, who controls
          interactions between these <strong>Groups</strong>. Any
          message and/or request/response for resources/services should be checked and approved by
          <strong>Curator</strong>. 
          <strong>Curator</strong> also works to deliver as many as possible <strong>Services</strong>
          like usual <strong>Node</strong>. Another type
          of <strong>Curator</strong> is <strong>Inter-Curator</strong>.
          <strong>Curators</strong> can set automatic approvals for selected connections and do only monitoring.
        </ul>

## Who is <strong>Inter-Curator</strong>?

        <ul>
          This is <strong>Node</strong>, approving requests to <strong>Services</strong>
          from or to other <strong>VNTs</strong>.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Service</strong>?

        <ul>
            <strong>Service</strong> - name+description of operation, which <strong>Node</strong>
            can do for the other
            <strong>Nodes</strong> inside own <strong>VNT</strong> or for the other <strong>VNTs</strong>.
            You can think about <strong>Service</strong> as about skill.
            <strong>Service</strong> description answers to a question “What I can do?”. 
            Example: “I can grade exam A”, “I can develop documentation about AAA”, 
            “I can develop schedule”. Service also has short name into reversed domain form 
            “servicename.servicegroup.organization”. Example: “schedule.team.company”, “tools.python.develop.team”.
            One <strong>Service</strong> can be supported by any number of <strong>Nodes</strong>. 
            <strong>Node</strong> also consumes <strong>Services</strong> from other <strong>Nodes</strong>. 
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Bot</strong>?

        <ul>
          This is <strong>Node</strong>, supporting some automatical <strong>Services</strong>, for
          example - add/remove <strong>Node</strong>,
          create/delete <strong>Group</strong>.
          Users can add more <strong>Bots</strong> via <strong>Bot Shop</strong>, 
          to offload <strong>Services</strong> operations from people.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Request</strong>?

        <ul>
          This is message from <strong>Node</strong> to <strong>Service</strong>. Routing application builds route for 
          <strong>Request</strong> between <strong>Nodes</strong> to reach <strong>Node</strong> which supports
          destination <strong>Service</strong>.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Reply</strong>?

        <ul>
          This is message from <strong>Node</strong> who supports <strong>Service</strong>,
          to <strong>Node</strong> – source of <strong>Request</strong>. 
          Inside – information that <strong>request</strong> was accepted, finished, or declined.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Filter</strong>?

        <ul>
          Any <strong>Node</strong> is able to install <strong>Filter</strong> on <strong>Service</strong>
          names, available for this <strong>Node</strong>. If <strong>Node</strong>
          is <strong>Curator</strong>, this <strong>Filter</strong> also limits access to
          <strong>Services</strong> for subsequent <strong>Groups</strong>.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Service Path</strong>?

        <ul>
          Owner of <strong>Service</strong> is able to set list of
          <strong>Pre-Services</strong> - other <strong>Services</strong>, which <strong>request</strong> should go
          through, before come to the <strong>Service</strong> owner for operation. For example, before release
          product, <strong>request</strong> should go via list of approvals.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Self-managing</strong>?

        <ul>
          Management <strong>Bots</strong> are supporting <strong>Services</strong> like “I can add new user”, 
          “I can create new group”, “I can create new Service”, “I can add node to existed service”. 
          Every user will be able to send <strong>Request</strong> to these <strong>Services</strong>.
          Access is controlled by position in the routing path.
          Example: "Bob" will place management <strong>Bots</strong> into <strong>Group</strong> “Admin” and will 
          connect “Alice” to both <strong>Groups</strong>: “Admin” and “Bob team”. So now if anybody from the
          “Bob team” will send <strong>request</strong> to “I can add new user” <strong>Service</strong> and ask
          to add new user, “Alice” should approve this request.
        </ul>

## How to implement <strong>self-automation</strong> process cycle?

        <ul>
          <li>Stimulate people to define as many as possible <strong>Services</strong> they do or able to do</li>
          <li>Join same <strong>Services</strong> together by renaming them to the same name</li>
          <li>Monitor <strong>Services</strong> use by people (count number of <strong>Requests</strong>)</li>
          <li>For <strong>Service</strong> which has highest load (and we can automate it) – check our bot-shop,
            order development from us or third-parties or develop by yourself application to support this <strong>Service</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Connect this application as a <strong>Node</strong>, register <strong>Service</strong> for 
            these <strong>Node</strong>.</li>
          <li>Remove <strong>Service</strong> from the people who did it before</li>
          <li>Repeat</li>
        </ul>

## Who can create new <strong>VNT</strong>?

        <ul>
          Anybody who is already member of any <strong>VNT</strong> is able to create
          new <strong>VNT</strong> and add people and bots there.
          After you create <strong>VNT</strong> and add people, you can remove yourself. 
          If <strong>VNT</strong>, which you created,
          purchases subscription services, you will receive some part of their payments as
          <strong>Credits</strong> to your personal inbox.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Credit/Debit</strong>?

        <ul>
          When you created new <strong>VNTs</strong>, which are purchasing subscription services, you will receive
          <strong>Credits</strong>. You can convert this <strong>Credits</strong> to your PayPal account money. 
          Also, VNT, where are you member and have it's <strong>Share</strong> value, can generate income or have loss,
          so according to your <strong>Share</strong> value for this VNT you can have also income or loss from it.
        </ul>

## What is <strong>Share</strong>?

        <ul>
          When you are member of <strong>VNT</strong>, you can have <strong>Share</strong> value, assigned to you
          by VNT management (or assign to youself if you manages this VNT).
          <strong>Share</strong> is your percent of <strong>VNT</strong> ownership.
          After any income or outcome transaction, calculation will be done to protect sum, needed for operational expences,
          and sum will be distributed
          among <strong>VNT</strong> members, according to assigned them <strong>Shares</strong> values with 
          additinal performance calculation, based on number of your <strong>Services</strong> and number of <strong>Requests</strong>
          you processed during measured time. This feature is under design now so more options will be provided.
        </ul>

## What are <strong>Campaign</strong> and <strong>Voting</strong>?

        <ul>
          When you operate VNT as one acting body, you need to have VNT decision making process,
          we propose it where any VNT member with <strong>Shares</strong> can initiate "campaign" to promote own idea or
          strategy decision, see other ideas and add supporting or supressing comments to any ideas, 
          but only members of 2 or more groups (<strong>Curators</strong>) also with <strong>Shares</strong> can Vote
          to support or suppress these ideas (according to their <strong>Share</strong> weight) - as result, only ideas, 
          approved and supported by Curators, should be implemented. During Voting process <strong>Curator</strong>
          can change opinion, so idea owner and idea supporters can change it during Voting process to receive more Votes.
          We expect to have VNT members who more work on promoting of their vision by
          submitting and promoting own ideas among VNT members, collecting support from Curators to direct all the VNT members
          to implement this idea.
        </ul>
